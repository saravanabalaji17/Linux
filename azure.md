There is a wide range of Microsoft Azure VM types that are optimized to meet various needs. Machine types are specialized, and vary by virtual CPU (vCPU), disk capability, and memory size, offering a number of options to match any workload.

With so many options available, finding the right machine type for your workload can be confusing ‚Äî which is why we‚Äôve created this overview of Azure VM types (as we‚Äôve done with EC2 instance types, and Google Cloud machine types). Note that while AWS EC2 instance types have names associated with their purpose, Azure instance type names are simply in a series from A to N. The chart below and written descriptions are a brief and easy reference, but remember that finding the right machine type for your workload will always depend on your needs.


General Purpose
General-purpose VMs have a balanced CPU and memory, making them a great option for testing and development, smaller to medium databases, and web servers with low to medium traffic:

DCsv2-series
The newest size recommendation in the DC-series, the DCsv2, stands out because of the data protection and code confidentiality it provides while it‚Äôs being processed in the cloud. SGX technology and the latest generation of Intel XEON E-2288G Processor back these machines ‚Äî these VMs can go up to 5.0GHz.

Av2 Series
A-series VMs have a CPU-to-memory ratio that works best for entry-level workloads, like those for development and testing. Sizing is throttled for consistent processor performance to run the instance. Av2-series has the option to be deployed on a number of hardware types and processors. To figure out which hardware the size should be deployed on, users must query the virtual hardware in the VM.

Dv2 and Dsv2-series
Dv2 VMs boast powerful CPUs ‚Äî roughly 35% faster than D-series VMs ‚Äî and optimized memory, great for production workloads. They have the same memory and disk configurations as the D-series, based upon either a 2.1 GHz, 2.3 GHz, or 2.4 GHz processor and Intel Boost Technology.

Dsv2-series sizes run on the same Dv2 processors with Intel Turbo Boost Technology 2.0 and also use premium storage.

Dv3-series
With expanded memory (from ~3.5 GiB/vCPU to 4 GiB/vCPU) and adjustments for disk and network limits, the Dv3 series Azure VM type offers the most value to general-purpose workloads. The sizes in this series offer a combination of memory, temporary storage, and vCPU that best fits best for enterprise applications, relational databases, in-memory caching, and analytics. It‚Äôs important to note that the Dv3-series no longer has the high memory VM sizes of the D/Dv2-series.
