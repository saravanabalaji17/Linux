Linux Process Management

What is a Process
===================
An instance of a program is called a Process. In simple terms, any command that you give to your Linux machine starts a new process


Types of Processes in Linux
=============================

Foreground Processes: They run on the screen and need input from the user. For example Office Programs
Background Processes: They run in the background and usually do not need user input. For example Antivirus.


To list the processes
=====================
# top
#ps ­efa
#ps -ef

To list all running processes
============================

#ps ­aux |less

TO list a specific user's processes
===================================

#ps ­u username


To customize the output of ps ­aux
====================================

#ps ­aux

OUTPUT

USER PID %CPU %MEM VSZ RSS TTY STAT START TIME COMMAND

# ps ­eo user,cpu,cmd ­­­­> option ­e is used for editing and option ­o is used to user define.
#  ps eo uid,user,pid,ppid,stat,cpu,cmd






fg
bg

jobs



#ps 
-a -> Shows information about all users.
-x -> Shows information about processes without terminals.
-e -> Displays extended information.
-u -> Shows additional information like -f option.









Parent process:
=================
In Linux all the processes have a parent process. When the user creates a process in that case the kernel process becomes
 the parent of that process.

Every Linux process has two ID's assigned to it, the Process ID (pid) and the Parent process ID (ppid).

For example:

[root@machine1 ~]# sleep 1000 &
[1] 1971
[root@machine1 ~]# ps -f
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root        1589    1588  0 09:25 pts/0    00:00:00 -bash
root        1971    1589  0 09:26 pts/0    00:00:00 sleep 1000
root        1972    1589  0 09:26 pts/0    00:00:00 ps -f
[root@machine1 ~]# pidof sleep
1971
[root@machine1 ~]# pstree 1589
bash---pstree
     +-sleep
[root@machine1 ~]#


Child Processes:
=================
The processes which gets created by another process it'ns parent process known as child process.

In our above example, the sleep process with PID 1971 is a child process of the bash process with PID 1589.


Daemon process:
===============
The system related background running processes are called Daemon Processes. 
When you see a process running with a ? mark in sixth column (TTY field), that's a daemon process.

[root@machine1 ~]# ps -ef
UID          PID    PPID  C STIME TTY          TIME CMD
root           1       0  0 09:24 ?        00:00:02 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --switched-root --system --deserialize 18
root           2       0  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [kthreadd]
root           3       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_gp]
root           4       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_par_gp]
root           5       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/0:0-events]
root           6       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/0:0H-events_highpri]
root           7       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/0:1-events]
root           8       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [kworker/u256:0-events_unbound]
root           9       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [mm_percpu_wq]
root          10       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [ksoftirqd/0]
root          11       2  0 09:24 ?        00:00:00 [rcu_sched]





Zombie processes:
=================
At times there are processes which are already dead but still shows up in process list are called Zombie processes.
These processes can be found while doing ps listing, the process with a Z state are zombie processes.
 They don't consume any CPU resources.






The process status can be any of the following:

R: Running

S: Sleeping

D: Uninterruptible sleep

T: Traced (stopped state)

Z: Zombie



1) R :­ Running process which is executed on cpu.

2) S :­ Sleeping or waiting process. This process is in waiting stage for a signal.

3) D :­ Uninterruptable. This process is in sleeping process which will not respond to a signal.

4) T :­ Stopped process or suspended process. This process can be continued by another signal to return to running process.

5) Z :­ Zombie process. This is a child process sending its parent process an exit signal.


TASK_RUNNING(R)		- task (process) currently running
TASK_INTERRUPTABLE (S)	- process is sleeping but can be woken up (interrupted)
TASK_UNINTERRUPTABLE(D)	- process is sleeping but can not be woken up (interrupted)
TASK_ZOMBIE	(Z)		- process terminated but its status was not collected (it was not waited for)
TASK_STOPPED(T)		- process stopped by a debugger or job control

SCHEDULING PRIORITIES
=====================

Every process have scheduling priorities.

The value which is assigned for scheduling the priorities is called "NICE VALUE"
Nice value range is -­20 to 19
­-20
­-19
­-18
­-17
­-16
­-15
­-14
­-13
­-12
­-11
­-10
­-9
­-8
­-7
­-6
­-5
­-4
­-3
­-2

19

The default nice value of a process is 0.
High nice value process means low CPU usage.(19)
Low nice value means High CPU usage.(-20)
The root user can increase or decrease the priorities of a process.
The normal user can only increase the priority of a process.

#ps ­eo user,pid,ni,cmd

Here NI is nice value
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

USER 	PID 	NI 	CMD
root 	1 	0 	/usr/lib/systemd/systemd

To schedule priorities.
=======================

1) For running process
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­
# renice nicevalue PID
# renice ­3 15232

2) For new process
­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­­

#nice ­n nicevalue command

#nice ­n ­7 cat
